                chewiness in every bite. Tossed with a colorful medley of crunchy vegetables and your choice of protein,
                they are coated in a savory, tangy sauce that brings everything together. From the first slurpy strand to
                the last, this dish delivers a harmonious mix of textures and bold, umami-packed flavors.

            <h2>Steps</h2>
            <ol>
                <li>Boil water in a large pot with a pinch of salt and oil. Add noodles and cook until "al dente" (cooked
                    but firm). Drain and rinse with cold water to stop cooking.</li>
                <li>Heat oil in a wok or large pan over high heat. Add chopped garlic and ginger, sautéing quickly for 30
                    seconds.</li>
                <li>Add the onions and vegetables (cabbage, carrots, capsicum). Stir-fry on high heat for 2 minutes (keep
                    them crunchy).</li>
                <li>If using chicken or eggs, add the cooked protein now.</li>
                <li>Add the soy sauce, vinegar, and chili sauce. Mix well.</li>
                <li>Toss in the boiled noodles and season with salt and pepper. Stir-fry for another 2 minutes to coat the
                    noodles evenly.</li>
                <li>Garnish with chopped spring onion greens and serve immediately.</li>
